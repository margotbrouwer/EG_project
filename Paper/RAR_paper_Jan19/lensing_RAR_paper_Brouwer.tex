\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

It has been known for several decades that the outer regions of galaxies rotate faster than would be expected from Newtonian dynamics, based on their luminous (baryonic) mass. This was first discovered by \cite{rubin1983} through measuring galactic rotation curves of optical disks, and by \cite{bosma1981} through measuring hydrogen profiles at radii beyond the disk. The excess gravity implied by these measurements have been generally attributed to an unknown and invisible substance named Dark Matter (DM), a term coined earlier by \cite{zwicky1937} when he discovered the missing mass problem through the dynamics of galaxies in clusters.

Following more recent observations using Weak gravitational Lensing \cite[WL,][]{hoekstra2004,linden2014,mandelbaum2015}, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations \cite[BAO's,][]{eisenstein2005,blake2011} and the Cosmic Microwave background \cite[CMB,][]{spergel2003,planck2015}, cold dark matter\footnote{DM particles that moved at non-relativistic speeds at the time of recombination, as favoured by measurements of the CBM \cite[]{planck2014} and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest \cite[]{viel2013}.} (CDM) became a key ingredient of the current standard model of cosmology: the $\lcdm$ model. In this paradigm, CDM accounts for $\Omega_{\rm CDM}=0.266$ of the critical density in the Universe, while the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ necessary to explain the accelerated expansion of the Universe (which is usually associated with dark energy; DE) accounts for $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}=0.685$.

Although the $\lcdm$ model successfully describes the behavior of DM on a wide range of scales, no conclusive evidence for the existence of DM particles has been found so far \cite[despite years of enormous effort; for an overview, see][]{bertone2005,bertone2018}. This still leaves some room for alternative theories of gravity, such as Modified Newtonian Dynamics  \cite[MOND,][]{milgrom1983} and the more recent theory of Emergent Gravity \cite[EG,][]{verlinde2016}. In these theories DM does not exist, and all gravity is due to the baryonic matter (or, in the case of EG, the interaction between baryons and the entropy associated with DE). Hence, one of the main properties of these theories is that the mass discrepancy in galaxies correlates strongly with their baryonic mass distribution.

Such a correlation has indeed been widely observed. First astronomers discovered the Tully-Fisher relation \cite[TFR,][]{tully1977} between the luminosity of a spiral galaxy and its asymptotic rotation velocity \cite[]{pierce1988,bernstein1994}. Since this corresponds to a relation between the baryonic and the total galaxy mass, this has later been named the `baryonic' TFR \cite[BTFR,][]{mcgaugh2000,mcgaugh2012}. As the radial resolution of observations increased, astronomers found a strong correlation between the observed rotation velocity $v\un{obs}(r)$ as a function of galaxy radius $r$, and the enclosed luminous mass \mbox{$m\un{bar}(<r)$} \cite[]{sanders1986,sanders1996,mcgaugh2004,sanders2007,wu2015}. Since $m\un{bar}(<r)$ corresponds to the \emph{expected} gravitational acceleration $g\un{bar}(r)$ from baryonic matter, and the observed gravitational acceleration can be calculated through $g\un{obs}(r)=v\un{obs}^2(r)/r$, this relation has been named the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR)\footnote{Another well-established name for this same relation is the Mass-Discrepency Acceleration Relation (MDAR), which refers to the correspondance between the observed baryonic/total mass and the inferred mass discrepency commonly attributed to DM. Throughout this work we use the term RAR for brevity.}.

Particularly, the latest results from \cite{mcgaugh2016} (hereafter M16) have measured the RAR relation with unprecedented accuracy, using the Spitzer Photometry and Accurate Rotation Curves \cite[SPARC,][]{lelli2016b} data of 153 late-type galaxies. Their results showed a tight correlation between $g\un{obs}$ and $g\un{bar}$, which they could fit using a simple double power law (Eq. 4 in M16) depending only on $g\un{bar}$ and one free parameter: the acceleration scale $g\un{\dagger}$ where Newtonian gravity appears to break down. This sparked the interest of scientists working on alternative theories of gravity, but also of those in favor of a statistical explanation of the RAR within the $\lcdm$ framework \cite[]{keller2017,desmond2017,ludlow2017}.

The latter possibility was quantified by \cite{navarro2017} (hereafter N17) who used a range of simplifying assumptions based on galaxy observations and DM simulations, in order to create an analytical galaxy+halo model. The goal of their model was to reconstruct the RAR in galaxies, in particular the value of $a\un{0}$: the acceleration scale where the relation transitions from the baryon-dominated to the DM-dominated regime (which is equivalent to $g\un{\dagger}$), and $a\un{min}$: the minimum acceleration probed by galaxy disks. Based on their results, they claimed that the RAR can be explained within the $\lcdm$ framework, at the accelerations probed by galaxy rotation curves (i.e. $g\un{obs}>a\un{min}$). However, since their model relies on the fact that luminous kinematic tracers in galaxies only probe a limited radial range, N17 predicted that extending observations to radii beyond the disk (which correspond to lower gravitational accelerations) would lead to systematic deviations from the simple relation posed by M16.

The goal of this work is to extend observations of the RAR to lower accelerations, which are not measurable using galaxy rotation curves. To this end we use gravitational lensing: the perturbation of light inside a gravitational potential as described by General Relativity (GR). In particular, we use the method of Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing (GGL): the statistical measurement of the coherent image distortion (shear) of a field of background galaxies (sources) by the gravitational potential of a sample of foreground galaxies (lenses) \cite[for examples, see e.g.][]{fischer2000ggl,hoekstra2004,mandelbaum2006,uitert2016}. Using GGL we can measure the average (apparent) density distribution of galaxies up to a radius of $3\,{\rm Mpc}$, roughly a $100$ times larger than the radius of the luminous disk ($\sim 30\,{\rm kpc}$), corresponding to a value of $g\un{bar}$ that is roughly $3$ orders of magnitude lower than those measurable with galaxy rotation curves.

First, we measure the baryonic and total density profiles of our galaxies through their luminosities and GGL profiles. These measurements will be performed using photometric data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey \cite[SDSS,]{abazajian2009} and the VISTA Kilo-Degree Infrared Galaxy survey \cite[VIKING]{edge2013}, and weak lensing data from the Kilo-Degree Survey \cite[KiDS,][]{dejong2017}. We then translate these measurements into the baryonic and observed radial accelerations, $g\un{bar}$ and $g\un{obs}$. Finally, we compare the resulting RAR to predictions from different modified gravity theories (MOND and EG) and $\lcdm$.

The $\lcdm$ predictions will not only be provided by the N17 analytical model, but also by two mock galaxy catalogues based on two different DM simulations. One is the Marenostrum Institut de Ci{\`e}ncies de l'Espai (MICE) Galaxy and Halo Light-cone catalog \cite[]{carretero2015,hoffmann2015}, which is based on the MICE Grand Challenge lightcone simulation \cite[MICE-GC,][]{fosalba2015a,fosalba2015b,crocce2015}. The other mock galaxy catalog is based on a suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which is called the BAryons and HAloes of MAssive Systems (BAHAMAS) project \cite[]{mccarthy2017}. Our final goal is to distinguish which of the aforementioned predictions best describe the RAR at lower accelerations.

Having over ... foreground galaxies at our disposal, we are able to select specific lens samples designed to optimally test these predictions. Particularly, we note that most models (MOND, EG, and the N17 analytical DM model) focus on the description of individual, isolated galaxies. In order to test them, therefore, we select a sample of galaxies whose lensing profiles are not affected by their neighbors within the radius of our measurement. In contrast, the predictions from the MICE and BAHAMAS simulations can be tested for both isolated and non-isolated galaxy samples.

Furthermore, we note that all models give a specific prediction regarding the dependence of the RAR on baryonic galaxy mass. According to the MOND and EG theories, the relation between $g\un{bar}$ and $g\un{obs}$ should remain intact in the regime beyond the disk, independent of the disk mass. Within the $\lcdm$ paradigm, however, all predictions (analytical and simulated) are based on a `stellar-to-halo-mass relation' which is not constant as a function of baryonic galaxy mass. By splitting our foreground galaxies into bins of increasing stellar mass, we are able to better distinguish the predictions of these different models.

Our paper is structured as follows: In Sect. \ref{sec:data} we introduce our main datasets: both the KiDS and GAMA galaxy surveys which are used to perform the GGL measurements, and the MICE and BAHAMAS simulations \& mock galaxy catalogues to which we compare our results. Sect. \ref{sec:analysis} describes our analysis of these (mock) datasets as we select our isolated foreground galaxy sample, perform the GGL measurements, and translate the results into the RAR. Sect. \ref{sec:predictions} contains a description of the theoretical predictions to which we compare our observations: MOND, EG and the N17 analytical DM model. In Sect. \ref{sec:results} we present the resulting RAR measurements and model comparison. Sect. \ref{sec:discon} contains the discussion and conclusion.

Throughout this work we adopt the WMAP 9-year \cite[]{hinshaw2013} cosmological parameters : $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.2793$, $\sigma_8=0.821$, $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}=0.7207$, and $H_0 = 70 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$, which were used as the basis of the BAHAMAS simulation.
The cosmological parameters used in creating the MICE-GC simulations are: $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.25$, $\sigma_8=0.8$, $\Omega_{\rm \Lambda}=0.75$, and $H_0 = 70 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$.
Throughout the paper we use the reduced Hubble constant $h_{70} \equiv \ H_0 / (70 \, {\rm km \, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}})$.

\begin{comment}
Points:

- Using the WL method, we can measure the (apparent) mass distribution of galaxies up to a radius that is $\sim100$ times larger than the radius of the galaxy itself, corresponding to an acceleration scale that is 4 orders of magnitude lower than $a_min$.
- By using the unadulterated WL equations to measure the (apparent) density distribution around foreground galaxies, we necessarily assume that the laws of GR hold with respect to the deflection of light by a gravitational potential.
- In EG, this is explained by the fact that... In MOND ...
