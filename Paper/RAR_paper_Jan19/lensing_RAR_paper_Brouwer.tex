%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}
%\pdfminorversion=5

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX
% installations will be fine) or prefer the old Computer Modern fonts, comment
% out the following line
%\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Write the beginning



\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

\subsection{KiDS source galaxies}
\label{sec:kids}
Write the beginning.
Need to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item What changes as we go to KiDS-1000 (K1000 paper?).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{GAMA foreground galaxies}
\label{sec:gama}
Write everything.

\subsection{KiDS foreground selection}
\label{sec:gamalike_kids}
Still need to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maciek's GL-KiDS selection criteria for K1000.
	\item Angus' stellar mass method for K1000.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{MICE mock galaxies}
\label{sec:mice_mocks}
Write everything.

\subsection{Bahamas mock galaxies}
\label{sec:bahamas_mocks}
Written by Kyle?

\section{Data analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Isolated galaxy selection}
\label{sec:isolation}
Write the beginning.
Still need to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item how to test the isolation criterion.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lensing measurement}
\label{sec:lensing}
Write the beginning.
Still need to know:
\begin{itemize}
	\item How (if?) the GGL-pipeline changes with K1000.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conversion to radial acceleration}
\label{sec:conversion}
Still need to know: whether we will use the SIS assumption or linear interpolation.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test both methods using the Bahamas simulation.
\end{itemize}
	
\section{Theoretical predictions}
\label{sec:predictions}

\subsection{Analytical CDM model}
\label{sec:analytical}
Written by Kyle?

\subsection{Modified Newtonian Dynamics}
\label{sec:MOND}
Write everything.

\subsection{Emergent Gravity}

Write everything.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
Write when the results are ready.
I still need:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The K1000 lensing catalogues with ANNz redshifts and stellar masses.
	\item The results from the Bahamas simulation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Isolated galaxies}

Computations for the $N$-body simulations were performed in part on the Orcinus supercomputer at the WestGrid HPC consortium (\url{www.westgrid.ca}), in part on the GPC supercomputer at the SciNet HPC Consortium. SciNet is funded by: the Canada Foundation for Innovation under the auspices of Compute Canada; the Government of Ontario; Ontario Research Fund - Research Excellence; and the University of Toronto.

This research is based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under programme IDs 177.A-3016, 177.A-3017 and 177.A-3018, and on data products produced by Target OmegaCEN, INAF-OACN, INAF-OAPD and the KiDS production team,  on behalf of the KiDS consortium. OmegaCEN and the KiDS production team acknowledge support by NOVA and NWO-M grants. Members of INAF-OAPD and INAF-OACN also acknowledge the support from the Department of Physics \& Astronomy of the University of Padova, and of the Department of Physics of Univ. Federico II (Naples).

GAMA is a joint European-Australasian project based around a spectroscopic campaign using the Anglo-Australian Telescope. The GAMA input catalogue is based on data taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey. Complementary imaging of the GAMA regions is being obtained by a number of independent survey programs including GALEX MIS, VST KiDS, VISTA VIKING, WISE, Herschel-ATLAS, GMRT and ASKAP providing UV to radio coverage. GAMA is funded by the STFC (UK), the ARC (Australia), the AAO, and the participating institutions. The GAMA website is \url{www.gama-survey.org}.

This work has made use of CosmoHub \cite[]{carretero2017}. CosmoHub has been developed by the Port d'Informaci{\'o}n Cient{\'i}fica (PIC), maintained through a collaboration of the Institut de F{\'i}sica d'Altes Energies (IFAE) and the Centro de Investigaciones Energ{\'e}ticas, Medioambientales y Tecnol{\'o}gicas (CIEMAT), and was partially funded by the ``Plan Estatal de Investigaci{\'o}n Cient{\'i}fica y T{\'e}cnica y de Innovaci{\'o}n'' program of the Spanish government.

This work has made use of {\scshape python} (\url{www.python.org}), including the packages {\scshape numpy} (\url{www.numpy.org}) and {\scshape scipy} (\url{www.scipy.org}). Plots have been produced with {\scshape matplotlib} \cite[]{hunter2007matplotlib}. The mock shear profiles from MICE are computed using {\scshape TreeCorr} (\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/TreeCorr}).

\emph{Author contributions:} All authors contributed to the development and writing of this paper. The authorship list is given in three groups: the lead authors (M. Brouwer, V. Demchenko, J. Harnois-D{\'e}raps), followed by two alphabetical groups. The first alphabetical group includes those who are key contributors to both the scientific analysis and the data products. The second group covers those who have either made a significant contribution to the data products, or to the scientific analysis.
